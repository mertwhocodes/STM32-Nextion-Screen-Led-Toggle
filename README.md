**Nextion HMI Screen communicates with STM32 series boards.**


How does Nextion HMI Screen communicates with STM32 series boards. We will use STM32cubeIDE, stm32f10c8 board called blue pill, and nextion 2.4-inch basic screen.
You can access all about that application explanation in my blog page > [STM32 Nextion Screen Led Toggle](http://mertwhocodes.com/index.php/en/2020/04/28/stm32-nextion-screen-first-usage/)
